# API Limiter for A Music Application - JAMSYNC

A music player application allows users to browse and play songs with 
rate-limiting features based on user roles, offering a seamless listening 
experience. It integrates strategies like Fixed Window and Token Bucket for 
efficient rate management, ensuring smooth interactions for both standard 
and premium users


# Project Contributions

### Vamsi
Vamsi spearheaded the project by conceptualizing the base idea and implementing the **Strategy** and **Observer** design patterns. He played a critical role in presenting the idea to the team, ensuring a solid foundation for the projectâ€™s architecture.

### Kaushik
Kaushik focused on building an intuitive **console-based UI** while implementing **Decorator**, **Command**, and **Builder** design patterns. His contributions ensured a seamless user experience and robust design implementation.

### Vinay
Vinay contributed significantly by extending the project features through the **State** and **Flyweight** design patterns. His implementation streamlined user state transitions and enhanced the playlist creation and song browsing experience.

### Vinod
Vinod developed the **Singleton** and **Factory** patterns for creating the music player. He ensured that the theoretical understanding of these patterns was clearly documented and leveraged them to achieve consistent and efficient object creation.

### Siddartha
Siddartha was instrumental in designing the **UML diagrams** that provided a visual representation of the architecture. Additionally, he debugged and rigorously tested the application, ensuring a high-quality end product.

### Chaitanya
Chaitanya brought the project to life through a professionally designed **presentation (PPT)**. He also incorporated **API data** by implementing file reading and managing CSV/Text files to simulate real-world datasets. Additionally, he played an active role in debugging and testing the application, improving its overall functionality and reliability.

### Satish
Satish enhanced the project by optimizing performance and integrating additional functionalities. He worked on implementing **rate limiting algorithms** using the **Fixed Window** and **Token Bucket** strategies to handle user actions effectively. He also documented the system flow and ensured the scalability of the application through advanced profiling and optimization techniques.
